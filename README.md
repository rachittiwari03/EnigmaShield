# EnigmaShield: Secure Messaging

# Overview:

EnigmaShield is a Python application designed for secure message communication. It features a user-friendly graphical interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Vigenère cipher. The project aims to improve message security and privacy while also serving as an educational tool for understanding basic cryptographic concepts.

# Key Features:

1. Vigenère Cipher: Implements the Vigenère cipher algorithm to ensure secure message transmission.
2. User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive graphical user interface enables users to easily input messages, keys, and choose encryption or decryption modes.
3. Educational Purpose: Ideal for interactive learning about cryptography, making it suitable for educational settings.
4. Customizable: Users can input messages and keys, making it adaptable for various use cases.
5. Portfolio Enhancement: Showcases skills in Python programming, GUI development, and cryptography for portfolio purposes.

# Usage:

1. Clone the EnigmaShield repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script to launch the application.
3. Input your message, key, and choose encryption or decryption modes.
4. Click "Show Message" to view the encrypted or decrypted result.
5. Use "Reset" to clear input fields and "Exit" to close the application.
